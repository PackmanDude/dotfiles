# dotfiles
My dotfiles

All directories (e.g. i3status) must be put in *.config* in your $HOME (~) directory.
And other files in root repo directory (e.g. bashrc) must be put in your home directory directly (also they must start with dot to be hidden).

My environment variables: (I'm using /etc/environment for setting them)
- PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:$PATH
- VISUAL=nano
- EDITOR=nano
- MANOPT=-L ru (need to install manpages-ru from AUR)
