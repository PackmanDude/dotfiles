## dotfiles
My dotfiles.

### Yay setup
Yay (Yet Another Yogurt) â€“ is an AUR helper, its config is currently unportable.  
To get the same behavior of it as mine, execute:
```bash
yay --combinedupgrade --save
```

Other things should work properly, when you copy each dotfile to their location.  
If it isn't, please, [report](https://github.com/PackmanDude/dotfiles/issues).
